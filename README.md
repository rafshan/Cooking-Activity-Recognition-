# Cooking-Activity-Recognition-
The difficulty of identifying a body's behavior based on sensor data, such as an  accelerometer in a smartphone, is known as activity recognition. It's among the most  widely studied topics in the field of machine learning-based classification. Cooking  Activity Recognition Challenge (CARC) asked participants to recognize food  preparation using motion capture and acceleration sensors. Two smartphones, two  wristbands, and motion-capturing equipment were used to collect three-axis (x, y,  z) acceleration data and motion data for the CARC dataset. One of the most challenging  difficulties to solve in this investigation was identifying complicated tasks as smaller  activities that are part of larger activities. Using a Convolutional Neural Network  (CNN) and a Bidirectional LSTM, weâ€™ve built a deep learning approach that extracts  dynamical data for macro and micro activity identification. The model we proposed for  that kind of dataset has a classification accuracy of 83% for macro activity and  85.3% for micro activity, respectively.
